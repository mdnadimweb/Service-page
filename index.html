          When a user activates a theme, they have an expectation of seeing their photos, theirs shop, their contributors and all of their content with a new style or twist. Themes provide this ability to showcase user content in different ways. How a theme gets that content 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
         is what we look for. When there is no content a theme should not show anything. This has been an issue in the past and this will hopefully add more information to that. Sounds simple, right?

         Looks simplistic. But what if you wanted to add a message letting the user know they have nothing to show or point them in the right direction to create a post. We donâ€™t want the entire world to know or even see that link
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
           This message has to have meaning for the user and not the world to see. This is where some may get tripped up because some will want to use what we consider demo content. So what we can do is add a capability check.
        </p>    
        <p class="mb-6">
          We use equipment that shears the water instead of blasting it like a carpet wand. This lets us use a high flow of water while leaving your furniture very dry. Your furniture will dry within minutes!
